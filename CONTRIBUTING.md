## Introduction
The project is designed to help and guide people who want to get notified about the latest Job and Scholarship updates.

## Why does this project exist?
- Lack of awareness about different opportunities available
- To reduce noise presence on the opportunites and help those who really want to upskill and get hired!

## What are we doing about it?
- Send [newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/boradesanket13) to all the subscribed users to make them aware about different opportunities
- Create a technical blog section.
